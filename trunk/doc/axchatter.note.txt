1.error PRJ0050: Failed to register output atl80.dll when building atl axtivex
  cause:because after the building, vs tring to register it, but the vc dlls are not there in the working directory, so command called by vc
 regsvr32 dllname got failed with that error.
2.do not build your dll into static lib when it reference system libs, 
  for it may get conflict with other modules which reference the same system libs.
3.C Run-Time Error R6034
Error Message
An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library without using a manifest. This is an unsupported way to load Visual C++ DLLs. You need to modify your application to build with a manifest. For more information, see the "Visual C++ Libraries as Shared Side-by-Side Assemblies" topic in the product documentation.
  resolution:
	1.Make sure the dependencies are of the right order.
	2.If it still does not work, you can make it a static .lib other than .dll
Marked*	3.Make sure all the dependencies, especially the inderect system libs are added to make sure the right manifest info is embedded into the .dll.
	  because if any system dll is missing, it won't create right embedded manifest into into the created .dll or exe.
